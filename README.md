# giflooper
A looper, for GIFs, for you.

# To Run
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
```

## The Concept
A search engine that uses the Giphy API to return a random loop of GIFs that fit the entered search terms.

## Techs
The server/application part will be in Python/Flask. The front-end will be done in React

## Current Goal
-Have 2 pages
-1))TitleHeader//SearchtermEntry
-2))ResultHeader//Resultloop
-Implement these in Flask first, then think about React
